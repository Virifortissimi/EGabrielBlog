# FAQ
### This is completely free? What's the catch?
> Yes, this is free. I like to give back as much as possible since I also benefitted from a program such as this. However if you'd like to show support either to me or any of the learners, That would be great as well.

### What would be the duration of the bootcamp?
> The bootcamp should run for 2 to 3 months.

### Would the Bootcamp be physical?
> Sadly, At this point we can only host virtual bootcamps. So all training, learning and discussions will be done on virtual platforms.

### Since this is free. How can i support the program?
> You can support the program in any of this 3 ways:
> - You can feature on any of our social streams(Youtube, TwitterSpace, Podcast)
> - You can donate to the program and specify what you want it used for
> - You can write articles about the program, about what you're learning or anything else that would be useful to other developers and have it feature on our blog
> To do any of this reach out to me via email at [connect@egabriel.dev](mailto:connect@egabriel.dev?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20support%20the%20program)
