Looking back at 2024, it was a mixed bag. Sure, it wasn’t my most productive year career-wise, but marrying the love of my life? `Absolute highlight!` That singular joy filled my heart but also took up most of my bandwidth. So now, as 2025 dawns, I’m recharged, refocused, and ready to go. Here’s how I plan to make this year a masterpiece:

## 1. Learn, Upskill, Conquer (With a Dash of AI)
2025 is my year of intentional growth. Whether it’s through a Master’s degree or diving into self-paced learning, I’m determined to expand my skills in SQL, Go, and DevOps. But here’s the twist: I plan to harness the breakthrough power of AI to make this journey smarter. AI tools can accelerate learning, generate code snippets, and even simulate scenarios for practice. By working alongside AI, I’m not just upskilling; I’m future-proofing my expertise.

## 2. Lights, Camera, Content!
This year, I want to amplify my voice. Articles, YouTube videos, TikTok posts—you name it, I’ll create it. I’ve realized that sharing knowledge is just as fulfilling as gaining it, and 2025 will see me stepping up as a content creator with consistency and creativity. Whether it’s breaking down tech concepts or sharing my journey, I’m ready to connect with a global audience.

## 3. egabriel.dev: A Digital Glow-Up
My personal website deserves a makeover! I want egabriel.dev to reflect my growth, serve as a hub for my projects, and shine as brightly as the ideas I plan to share. Think sleek, think functional, think “wow.” By the end of 2025, egabriel.dev will be a space that truly represents who I am and where I’m headed.

## 4. Foodbot.ng 2.0
Foodbot.ng is getting a brain boost this year. With the power of AI, I aim to make it smarter, more intuitive, and—most importantly—profitable. From personalized meal plans to efficient user interactions, AI will transform Foodbot into something truly innovative. It’s time to monetize, expand its reach, and make it the go-to tool for food lovers everywhere.

## 5. Seeking New Horizons
As much as I love my homeland, I’m exploring opportunities beyond its borders. A better life, more resources, and a broader perspective are calling my name. The thought of starting fresh in a new environment excites me. Here’s to embracing the challenge and making the leap to a brighter future!

## 6. Building Scalefort.org: A Community to Grow Together
I dream of transforming my bootcamp into a full-fledged platform—Scalefort.org. This isn’t just about teaching; it’s about scaling first and growing as a community. Enthusiasts in C#, DevOps, cloud, and Go will find a home here—a place to learn, collaborate, and thrive. By fostering a culture of shared growth, I hope to empower others to reach their goals while reaching for mine.

2025 is my blank canvas, and I’m ready to paint it bold and bright. Whether it’s learning, creating, building, or exploring, every step will bring me closer to the life I envision. Here's to growth, community, and making big dreams come true. Let’s scale, together.
