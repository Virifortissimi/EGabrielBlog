Back then, there is a saying that `"Girls/Women are met to be in the kitchen"`. That era has ended. Now, women are a great asset to this world. Women are dominating and bringing more value and impact to the table and this nation.

I just started a tech journey with EGabriel Bootcamp. I am a .Net Developer. I believe for you to grow and stand out, learning must be a continuous process, we learn, improve and achieve bigger things every day.

In this Bootcamp tech journey with EGabriel, I hope to achieve the following:

- Getting acquainted with C#, [ASP.Net Core](http://asp.net/) and Web APIs.
- Building Web applications and Web APIs for real-life products.
- Ability to read codes, and debug errors from my code and existing ones.
- Ability to write a unit test for codes to test their functionality.
- Ability to deploy web applications to the cloud.

Now how do I hope to achieve all these?

As I said learning is a continuous process, you never stop learning if you want to achieve much.

- By consistently devoting myself to practice.
- Building personal projects.
- Challenging myself daily with algorithms to improve my reasoning ability.
