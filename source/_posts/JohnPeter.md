As a potential software developer with some programming knowledge and a little bit of experience in frontend development currently, I still have a lot to learn when it comes to developing robust backend systems, building complex applications, and working with databases.

To that end, I enrolled in a .NET programming bootcamp. Here’s what I hope to achieve in the [bootcamp](https://www.egabriel.dev/bootcamp/), and how I plan to achieve my goals.

**Learn the Fundamentals of C# Programming:*** My first goal is to gain a strong understanding of the fundamentals of C# programming. This includes learning about data types, variables, operators, control structures, and functions. I hope to be able to write C# code from scratch and understand how to leverage Visual Studio Code (I use Linux)to build .NET applications. To achieve this goal, I plan to use all resources provided and complete all assignments and projects on time.

**Build Complex Applications Using .NET:** My second goal is to learn how to build complex applications using .NET. This includes working with object-oriented programming principles, such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. I hope to be able to build applications that can handle large amounts of data and interact with external APIs. To achieve this goal, I plan to work on individual projects and collaborate with other participants on group projects.

**Learn About Database Design and Management:** My third goal is to gain an understanding of database design and management using C#. This includes learning about database models, data normalization, querying data using SQL, and managing databases. I hope to be able to design and implement databases that can support complex applications. To achieve this goal, I plan to use the resources at my disposal, complete assignments, and projects, and seek feedback from instructors and other participants.

**Improve My Problem-Solving Skills:** My final goal is to improve my problem-solving skills. I hope to be able to approach complex programming challenges with a clear and systematic approach. To achieve this goal, I plan to practice writing pseudocode, breaking down complex problems into smaller components, and seeking feedback from instructors and other participants.

Overall, I’m excited to start my journey in the [EGabriel programming bootcamp](https://www.egabriel.dev/bootcamp/) and look forward to achieving these goals. I know it will be challenging, but I believe that with hard work, dedication, and the support of my peers and instructors, it’s possible.
